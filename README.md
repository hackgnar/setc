# SETC: Security Exploit Telemetry Container Framework

The Security Exploit Telemetry Collection (SETC) framework will be released at the IEEE CARS conference on October 28th, 2024. The project's first alpha release will be available here starting on the first day of the conference.

The SETC framework enables automated, reproducible vulnerability exploitation data collection at scale. Currently, security researchers face three significant limitations when collecting vulnerability data:
* First, when data comes from real-world incidents or security competitions, it's not repeatable - if researchers need additional data points, there's no way to recreate the exact scenario.
* Second, researchers are restricted to events outside their control - they can't study specific vulnerabilities or attack techniques on demand.
* Finally, manual attack simulation is extremely time and resource-intensive, requiring significant setup and execution effort for each scenario.

SETC addresses these challenges through a novel framework architecture. More about the project can be found on the pre-release paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05942) or in the official IEEE paper being released at [CARS](https://ieee-cars.org/).
